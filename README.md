# Linear-Optimization
My Coursework on Optimization Model module

Optimisation modelling: mathematical programming, including extensive studies of linear programming and dynamic programming; integer programming, introduction to non-linear optimisation, introduction to algorithms and heuristics.

In the assigment I was tasked to formulate five problems as linear programming models and solve the models by using Python Pulp Solver. There are five .py files uploaded in this repository, representing each of the problem.

In the excel file, I detailed how I structure the problem and prepare the data to be the input for Python Pulp Solver.

Code is mainly based on V. Deinenko's.
